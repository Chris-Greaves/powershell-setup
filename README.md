# PowerShell Setup

This is a repo containing scripts and configs for setting up PowerShell and Terminals exactly how I like them.

## Usage

You will need to run the `install.ps1` script as an administrator.

## Stuff to add

- Automatically add Nerd Fonts so Oh My Posh themes can work
- Config for Windows Terminal
- Config for Terminus
- [?] Update VSCode config to set default terminal font to be the Nerd Font one
